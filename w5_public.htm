        <td> 'The Fish' is an object named for its curious morphology in molecular hydrogen as shown.
            The 'eye' is a young star.  The border of the Fish is molecular
            hydrogen that has been excited and is shining in the near infrared.
            The striations are an instrumental effect of the narrow-band
            filters on NICFPS, the instrument used to take this data

        <td> This isophotal surface plot is of IC 1396 and SH 2-201, pieces of
            the western part of W5.  It resembles a dragon and, in this
            orientation, vaguely resembles the Welsh Flag.  Around the office,
            we refer to it as the Welsh Flag Nebula.  The data was taken using
            the HARP-B instrument on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope.  It is
            carbon monoxide (CO) emission measured at submillimeter (~850
            micron) wavelengths.  The 3D structure is from the velocity of the 
            gas, which is moving at a few kilometers per second (not very fast
            in astronomical terms.)
