<br>
<br> From July 6th through August 6th, 2010, I co-taught
<b>ASTR 1120: Stars and Galaxies</b> with <a href="http://www.devinsilvia.com" class="norm">Devin Silvia</a>. 
The website is on CU Learn, though  <a class="norm" href="summer1120/index.htm">lectures are posted here</a>.
<bR>
<br> I was TA for <b><a class="norm" href="astr3520_2008/index.html">ASTR 3520: Spectroscopy</a></b>
in fall <a href="3520site/index.html">2007</a>, fall 2008, and Spring 2010
(not offered 2009)
<!--(also, see <a class="norm" href="3520site/index.html">last year's site</a>)-->
<br>
I was TA for <b>ASTR 3510: Imaging</b> during the 2008 spring semester, 
and again during the <a class="norm" href="http://cosmos.colorado.edu/astr3510/">2009 Fall semester</a>.
<br>
        <br> While I was TA for ASTR 3520 during Fall 2007, I made the majority of the web pages at 
        <a class="norm"  href="http://casa.colorado.edu/~bally/ASTR3520/public/">the ASTR 3520 Fall 07 class web page</a>
        [<a class="norm" href="3520site/">archived version</a>]. 
        Below are two versions
        of a lecture I gave, but future lectures are not likely to be powerpoint
        (PDF is more portable).

        <h3> My thoughts on teaching:</h3>
        Please <a href="mailto:keflavich+teaching@gmail.com">contribute</a>
        your own too.  If you're faculty reading this, don't take offense at
        the directness of the language: it's harsh because it's self-directed.
        However, I believe the advice I give below.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br> I've learned a few lessons from TAing and taking classes:
        <ol>
            <li> Know the material (I already knew this, but it doesn't hurt to repeat)
            <li> Get the essentials done early.  TEST on the essentials early.
            <li> Do not give vague or late due dates.  A student's guilty
            conscience doesn't kick in until 2-3 days before the deadline no
            matter how big the project is
            <li> Don't lecture from a powerpoint.  Powerpoints are good for
            discussions and image display, they are not independent teaching
            tools.
        </ol>
        <br>
        <br> Lessons learned exclusively from spectating:
        <ol>
            <li> Write then talk.  Do not write and talk at the same time.
            <li> Seriously.  Write, get out of the way, let students write things down, THEN talk.
            <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corollary:  If there is "too much material" to write it all down AND talk about it,
            DO NOT COVER THAT MATERIAL.  The students will not absorb it.  Hand out notes and point out key
            pieces.  Except for the most extraordinary minds in the world, students cannot think and write 
            simultaneously - and even those minds can't do it consistently for a whole semester.
            <li> Ask questions, then pause.  No answers will be forthcoming in <5 seconds, few in <15
            <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corollary: Ask lots of questions.
            <li> No homework assignment should be more than one page, front side, reasonable font size.
            If it is, split it into TWO assignments.
            <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Revised: Just make homeworks reasonable.  Duplex them too.
            <li> Even simple coding takes a long time.  Account for that in assigning homeworks.
        </ol>
