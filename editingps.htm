    <h1> Editing Postscript </h1>
    It might seem odd to want to edit a postscript file - which is generally an image - 
    via a text interface, but it can be quite useful and is not terribly difficult.
    It came as a surprise to me when I discovered that postscript is actually human-
    readable, but except for the image binary sections, it is.
    <br>
    <br>
    For the example, we'll use the DS9-generated postscript <a class="norm" href="images/ds9dustmapps.ps">image</a>
    from the <a class="norm" href="ds9tips.htm#coordgrid">DS9 Tips Page</a>.
    <br>
    <br> To simply remove the colorbar, delete lines 347-393.  This is the first image section of the postscript, I
    identified it as the colorbar by noting that it is much smaller than the other image section.  Now we know that
    DS9 chooses to draw the colorbar first.  Lines 333-346 should also be deleted as they are setup commands for the
    colorbar.
    <br>
    <br>
    The next - and for me final - step is to tighten the bounding box 
    so that the ps file does not include extra
    whitespace.  
    <br>
    <br> The original bounding box is:
    <tt> %%BoundingBox: 36 226 576 566</tt>
    <br>I found that the bounding box parameters 
    <tt>  %%BoundingBox: 120 256 455 555 </tt> worked well via a simple process guess-and-check using ghostview.
    <br>
    <br> I found <a class="norm" href="images/ds9dustmapmodps.ps">the results</a> to be significantly nicer than
    the original DS9-generated image.
