GOALS:
Learn to use the UNIX command line and the COSMOS computers.  Set up IRAF, the Image Reduction and Analysis Facility.

BASIC UNIX:
Note that ALL commands in unix are case-sensitive.
1. Open a terminal.  The > prompt is called the "command line prompt".
2. Type 'ls' and press enter (press enter after all commands).  'ls' is short for LiSt; it lists the contents of the current directory
3. Type 'man ls'.  'man' is short for manual and will display help for a command.  It is not always helpful, though.
4. Type 'cd Desktop', then 'ls'.  You will Change Directories to the Desktop directory and list its contents.  It may be empty.
5. Type 'nedit test.txt &'.  'nedit' is a graphical text editor.  This command will open a new file test.txt on your desktop.  The '&' is necessary to open the editor "in the background" - if you do the command without '&', you will not be able to enter any more commands at the command line until you close nedit.
6. Make whatever edits you like, save the file, then close it.
7. Type 'rm test.txt'.  This will ReMove the file.

IMAGE VIEWING:
Astronomical images are stored in .fits format.  These are two-dimensional arrays of numbers representing (usually) the sky brightness.  They are therefore monochromatic.  We use DS9 to view these images and make color images.
1. Type 'ds9 /home/shared/astr3510/crabnebula.fits &'.  If you don't want to type all of that text, try using the 'tab' key at various points along the way.  This shortcut is known as "tab completion".
2. Play with the "transfer function" by right-clicking on the image and moving your mouse around.  Horizontal controls the "bias" or the zero-point, vertical controls the contrast.
3. Change the scaling under the scale menu.  Try MinMax, 99.5%, and zscale.

STARTING IRAF:
IRAF has its own special command line.
1. Type 'pwd'.  It will print your Present Working Directory.
2. If you are not in your home directory, type 'cd ~'.
3. Type 'mkdir iraf' to MaKe a DIRectory.
4. Type 'cd iraf'
5. Type 'mkiraf'.  If you are asked to "Initialize uparm" answer 'n'.
6. Type 'pyraf'.

Advanced usage:
Command history searching is a very nice feature.  To enable it, add these two lines to your .cshrc:
bindkey ^[[A history-search-backward
bindkey ^[[B history-search-forward
^[[A, ^[[B are written by pressing <ctrl-v> and then the <up> and <down> keys, respectively

There are much more powerful, but somewhat more difficult-to-learn editors:
nedit - very simple terminal-based editor
emacs - very powerful editor, easy to learn at first
vi - very powerful editor, hard to learn at first but has syntax very similar to the unix shell

GREP is used to grab only lines containing certain text, e.g. grep fits list.txt
Stream editor SED: http://sparky.rice.edu/~hartigan/sed.html
Another magical device AWK: http://sparky.rice.edu/~hartigan/awk.html

If you don't like csh, you can use the command 'chsh' to switch to bash.
