		<br> In order to remotely login to cosmos, do the following:
                <ol>
                    <li> Open a terminal on a UNIX system.  If you do not have a UNIX system available, see below.
                    <li> Type <tt>ifconfig</tt> and record your IP address.  An
                    IP address has the form #.#.#.#, where each # is a number
                    between 0 and 254.
                    <li> Type <tt>xhost +cosmos.colorado.edu</tt>.  You should
                    get a response similar to "cosmos.colorado.edu being added
                    to access control list".  If you don't, don't worry about
                    it, just continue on.
                    <li> Type <tt>ssh -XY (yourname)@cosmos.colorado.edu</tt>,
                    where (yourname) should be replaced by your username, e.g.
                    <tt>ssh -XY ginsbura@cosmos.colorado.edu</tt>.  Enter your
                        password when prompted.  If you receive a strange
                        question about security, respond "yes".
                    <li> To check whether you have access to graphics, attempt to load a graphical terminal, e.g. ds9. 
                    <li> Pray your internet connection is fast and you're set.
                </ol>

		<br> <h3> Remote Login for Windows </h3>
		<br> You can login remotely from windows using an ssh client, preferably
                <a class="norm" href="http://www.ssh.com/support/downloads/secureshellwks/non-commercial.html">SSH Secure Shell</a>,
                but the graphics aren't trivial.  I
		will have to communicate with the CU IT department to find out if this
		is possible, as it requires proprietary software.  Please e-mail me if you'd like me to 
		do that, otherwise I'll skip it for now.

                if this does not work!  Most of this is
                experimental for me, so if there's some failure in my
                instructions, I may be able to correct it, but don't be
                surprised.

                <br> <h3> Login (ssh and scp) without a password </h3>
                You can log in to a remote machine without a password using the following method:
                <ol>
                    <li> Use <code> ssh-keygen -r rsa </code> to generate a key file (default is <code>id_rsa</code>) and store it in <code>~/.ssh/</code>
                    <li> Copy your key file to the remote computer (<code> scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa name@remote.computer:. </code>)
                    <li> Log in to the remote computer and append your key to <code> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys </code>, e.g. 
                    <code> ssh name@remote.computer
                        cat id_rsa >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
                        </code>
                    </ol>
