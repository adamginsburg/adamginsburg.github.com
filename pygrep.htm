<h3> "Grep" in Python </h3>
<tr><td> I use Python as a command line tool.  I wanted to be able to do something similar to <tt>dir() | grep cmd</tt> to find out 
    what packages had been loaded and variables created.  I got sick of searching the net and finding nothing, so here's a simple script
    that does effectively the same thing (with slightly more tedious syntax):</td></tr>

<code class="prettyprint">
             readfile("python/grep.py"); ?&gt;           
        </code>
<!-- ?php
$current_path=ini_get("include_path");
ini_set("include_path","$current_path:/opt/local/PEAR:/opt/local/PEAR/lib");
require_once "Text/Highlighter.php";
$hlPY =& Text_Highlighter::factory("PYTHON");

$myFile = "python/grep.py";
$fh = fopen($myFile, 'r');
$theData = fread($fh, filesize($myFile));
fclose($fh);

echo $hlPY->highlight($theData);

<br/> If you know of a better (i.e. cleverer) way to accomplish this same feat, please let me know!
    <br/> Two of the solutions above were provided by a visitor, and I think they are a better solution to the problem presented here.
    <br/> Personally, I haven't ended up using the 'grep' function as much as I expected; instead I tend to get by on using the 
    Python debugger (pdb) and working on a smaller globals()/locals() list and using who/whos at the ipython command line.

    If you are interested in using python on the unix command line in place of grep, I recommend <a class="norm" href="http://www.zazzybob.com/bin/grep.py.html">the second hit on google</a>
