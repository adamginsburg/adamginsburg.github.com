<table align="center" border=".1" width="800">
<tr><th>Facetious list</th> <th> Serious list</th> </tr>
<tr><td>Learn to love coffee</td><td> Prepare to work long hours</td></tr>
<tr><td>Use your peers: they are tools</td> <td> Use your peers.  Work with them.  They are your collaborators and fellows
                on a tough journey.  You don't have to compete with them for jobs until after grad school </td></tr>
<tr><td>Work a 40 hour week</td><td>Don't try to match your advisor's hours - you probably can't - but don't think you'll
                be able to work 40 hours or less for the majority of your career from now on. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Self promotion is the only way to go </td><td> Get your advisor to help sell you around at conferences (and make
                sure to go to some!), but help yourself too: make a web page with your CV, let people know what you're working on </td></tr>
<tr><td>Make sure your hobbies are marketable skills </td><td>Be aware of the tight job market:  have some idea of what 
                you'd like to do if you don't get a tenure track job in 10 years.  If you can't think of an alternative option 
                using your PhD, make sure you still want it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Beer is your best friend</td><td> Beer is your best friend.  Make sure you relax often enough that you don't burn out.
        </td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="sketch.htm">Homebrew</a> because you can't afford real brew.</td><td>Homebrew because it's awesome, and might be a marketable hobby,
                and it produces beer (beer!).  Also, though, homebrewing isn't really cheaper, at least not for the first 5-10 batches </td></tr>
<tr><td>Grad students don't have any friends.  Other grad students aren't real people, they don't count. </td><td> Social life as
                a grad student tends to be very limited.  With homework loads in the first year or two, you don't see a whole lot of people
                outside of your classmates and possibly your students.  By the time you're done with classes, you probably don't want to 
                associate with undergrads all that much anyway.  Find another outlet.</td></tr>
