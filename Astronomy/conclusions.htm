<p align="center">There is probably a structural difference between the inner and outer 
portions of the Eskimo Nebula, and certainly an ionization difference, probably 
caused by temperature difference.</p>
<p align="center">There is approximately the same relative prevalence of SII and 
OIII in the inner vs. outer parts of the nebula.&nbsp; Both are more prevalent 
in the outer part, SII being about 70% as prevalent in the inner as the outer 
and OIII 63% as prevalent in the inner as the outer.&nbsp; HeII is also less 
prevalent in the inner part of the nebula, being about 80% as prevalent.&nbsp; 
This prevalence, though, may not necessarily indicate a prevalence of the 
elements but instead indicates prevalence of certain ionization energies.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">The distribution of these elements may be consistent with stellar 
evolution theory, which posits that planetary nebulae are formed from dying 
low-mass stars as they pulsate.&nbsp; They expand and eject an outer layer of 
material, then collapse, and expand again, ejecting more material.&nbsp; This 
process continues, but each time the star expands, it spews heavier elements 
formed as the star's fusion process achieves more advanced stages.&nbsp; In the 
first layer of gas expelled, most of it will be unfused hydrogen, and there will 
also be a lot of helium, which is the first product of stellar fusion.&nbsp; As 
the star gets older and fusion proceeds further, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, 
sulfur, and sodium will be produced.&nbsp; More of the heavier elements will be 
produced and sprayed from the star in later pulses.&nbsp; However, it is 
possible that we see more oxygen in the outer band because the temperature is 
too great to allow OIII emission in the inner part of the nebula.&nbsp; Helium 
is expected to be more prevalent in the outer parts, since it is the first 
(outermost) product of stellar fusion. </p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">It may also make sense to conclude that the Eskimo Nebula is a 
fairly old planetary nebula.&nbsp; Planetary nebulae will spray elements up to 
1.5 light years away before they cease to be visible.&nbsp; Since the outermost 
visible layer of the nebula contains substantial amounts of oxygen and sulfur, 
the star is probably in the later stages of its evolution.&nbsp; Elements are 
produced in order of increasing mass up until Iron, which has the most stable 
nucleus, but Iron is not produced in low-mass stars that produce planetary 
nebulae.&nbsp; </p>

<p align="center">Sources of Error:</p>
<p align="center">The sky was brighter later in the night, as some slight cloud 
cover moved in.&nbsp; This may have caused problems with some of the 
measurements, particularly of the elements providing smaller counts.&nbsp; </p>
