Title:

Dust emission from P Cygni's Nebula


Abstract:

We propose to observe the circumstellar LBV nebula around P Cygni to search for
emission from cool dust.  Observations of the [Fe II] 1.64\um emission line
using a coronagraph have revealed the the emission nebula is clumpy throughout.  
Other LBV nebulae with [Fe II] emission also tend to have warm dust, and a 
measurement of the dust in P Cygni's nebula will provide a direct constraint on 
the mass lost in the eruption event in 1600.  


Science Justification:


Luminous Blue Variables (LBVs) represent a short stage in the evolution of the
most massive stars.  Their ejectae may be responsible for the shapes of the
light curves of Type II supernovae (e.g. Smith and McCray 2007) and could be
the explanation of the ring nebula around SN 1987A (Smith 2007).  LBV shell
ejection events are the most energetic events in a main sequence star's
lifetime, sometimes involving energy expenditures just shy of supernovae
(Smith 2006).  

Because P Cygni has no known binary companion, in contrast to Eta Carinae which
has a very clear 5.54 year periodicity that implies the presence of a
companion, it may provide a more pure laboratory for the study of LBV ejectae.

Recent observations of P Cygni in the near-IR [Fe II] 1.64\um line have
displayed an inner portion of the nebula in greater detail than has been
possible in optical observations. They revealed a clumpy, asymmetric structure
that, contrary to expectations from slit spectroscopy (Smith and Hartigan
2006), is not limb-brightened.  The bright inner nebula has a spatial extent of
$\sim$20" ($\sim$.12 pc, assuming a distance of 1.7 kpc). These 
observations imply that P Cygni's nebula is not a hollow shell but a clumpy, at 
least partly filled blob with only partial spherical symmetry.

Smith and Hartigan measured a shell width of $\sim$.017pc under the 
assumption that
the nebula is simply a hollow shell, which implies that clumps will be 
simimately that size.  The dust we expect to observe is therefore 
constrained to small clumps or filaments, so it will be faint.  Assuming a 
distance of $10^{17.3}$ cm from the star, the expected dust temperature is 
$\sim$70K, giving a blackbody peak around 40\um.

QUESTION (as in, delete this paragraph from proposal):
[What temperature do we REALLY expect?  Cloudy suggests 68K before I put in any
grains, but then gave me temperatures $\sim$180-250K with Orion grain 
abundances
input.  I can talk to John about this, though... it's a simple calculation, but 
I'm missing some piece of it]

This [Fe II] emission line is a good tracer of shock-excited emission, and the
line's strength suggests significant variations in density in a vaguely
point-symmetric, concentric structure.  In all other LBV nebulae with [Fe II]
emission, warm dust emission is also seen (REF?).  P Cygni, as the nearest
unobscured LBV, has been the motivator for the current models of LBV evolution
(Smith, Vink, and de Koter 2004), but dust emission has not yet been observed
in its nebula.  The measured gas mass of .1 solar masses (Smith and Hartigan, 
2006) suggests a dust mass of .001 solar masses, which would be consistent with 
some known LBVs but is on the low end of the mass-loss spectrum (Clark 2003).

A measurement of the dust emission from P Cygni's nebula will provide
constraints on physical quantities, i.e. mass and kinetic energy, of the
ejected shell that is presumed to have come from P Cygni's eruption in 1600.  

While previous optical observations of nebulosity around P Cygni reveal a rich
ejection history from the star (Barlow et al 1994, Boumis et al 2006, Meaburn 
et al 2004, Meaburn et al 2000), they do not directly measure kinematic 
properties of these ejecta and therefore tell little about the processes 
involved in the ejection.  They have also been mostly unable to image the 
ejected nebula from the 1600 event, which will likely be the most observable 
region in the 20\um images.  Adaptive Optics observations of the innermost 
portion of P Cygni's nebula were limited by a 1" field of view (Chesneau et al 
2000).

Determinations of the circumstellar material's kinematic properties are
necessary to constrain models of the ejection mechanism.  In particular, Eta
Carinae's eruption in the 1840s is proposed to have been from a hydrodynamic
explosion (Smith and Townsend 2007).  It is unclear whether P Cygni's multiple
ejectae were ejected in similar hydrodynamic-driven expulsions or
radiation-driven mass loss events.

Experimental Design:

Images of P Cygni's nebula in the Qa (Q'?) filter are requested in order to 
observe cool thermal dust emission.  Two separate observations, centered 
$\sim$5" from the central star and on opposite sides, will be required so 
that the 15" chop does not overlap with the nebula.

Imaging in Qa (Q'?) has two significant advantages over other bands.  First, 
the longer wavelength will sample the dust at a point closer to its blackbody 
peak.  Second, the contribution of the stellar photosphere and free-free 
emission from its stellar wind both drop at longer wavelengths.

PI Nathan Smith has attempted detections of dust in P Cygni's nebula using 3m
telescopes at 10\um, but has not observed it.  A larger aperture operating at
longer wavelengths is needed to detect the thin, cold layer of dust that is
expected.  The resolution of an 8m telescope is also required because the dust 
is expected to be in thin, filamentary structures that are washed out in images 
from smaller telescopes.


Technical Description:

P Cygni's nebula will be observed with two separate pointings, offset 5" in RA 
from the star in opposite directions, in the Qa (Q'?) filter.  In order to 
achieve a S/N ratio of $\sim$10, assuming a surface brightness of 10 mJy / 
sq arcsec, a 120 minute exposure with chop/nod (50% of time on source) will be 
required.
