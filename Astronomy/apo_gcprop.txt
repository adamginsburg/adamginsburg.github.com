Half Nights or Hours Requested:
Two half nights out of:
First half July 1 - July 20

Instruments:
TripleSpec

Scientific Justification:
Positronium has never been observed in its Balmer transition lines.  The most 
likely point sources for positronium are near the Galactic Center and are 
thought to be compact objects traveling through dense molecular clouds.  To date,
only weak upper limits on the Paschen-gamma line have been obtained; with TripleSpec
we will be able to take observations nearly an order of magnitude more sensitive
of both the Paschen-gamma and Hydrogen-alpha lines of the positronium atom.

Our three targets will be the Great Annihilator, GROJ1655-40, and GRS1758-258
