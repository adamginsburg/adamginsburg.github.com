<p> </p>
<p>The paper's conclusions were narrowed down to five.  <br/>
(i) All 14 galaxies observed contained WR lines.  All were dominated by 
late WN stars.  Nine galaxies showed WCE emissions.<br/>
(ii) WCL lines are present in 6 galaxies.   This is expected in high 
metallicity galaxies.  However, NGC 7714A and NGC 4861 are both claimed to 
have WCL stars present, but they have low metallicities.<br/>
(iii) Low metallicity galaxies show good agreement with SV98 models for N<font size="1">WR</font>/N<font size="1">O</font> 
values.  <br/>
(iv) Mid and high metallicity galaxies with 12+log[O/H]&gt;8.4 gave lower N<font size="1">WR</font>/N<font size="1">O
</font>values than predicted.  TiO lines suggest the presence of older 
stellar populations, and the WN/WC values suggest that the bursts are in the 
late stages of their WR episodes.  A good model for these galaxies is an 
extended burst.<br/>
(v) Results do not confirm the prediction that the relative number of WR stars 
would increase with increasing metallicity.  Uncertainties in this 
conclusion arise from uncertainties in the luminosity of a single WR star and 
uncertainties associated with the best choice of the dominant contribution of WR 
subtype in the high metallicity regime.</p>

<p>a. Organization<br/>
The paper was fairly well organized.  I had little difficulty navigating 
through the paper and discovering which parts were most significant for my 
project, especially after I had a good understanding of the basic concepts (i.e. 
somewhere around the 3rd reading)</p>
<p>b. Readability<br/>
For the most part, the paper was acceptably readable.  I had some issues 
during the first few readings because I didn't really understand what was being 
talked about.  However, after I looked to other sources for explanations of 
concepts I had not heard of (e.g. Salpeter IMF slopes), everything fit together 
rather well.  Being an inexperienced astronomer/astrophysicist, it was 
sometimes difficult to understand the significance of certain equations or 
concepts, but eventually I picked up on them.</p>
<p>c. Convincingness of results and conclusions<br/>
The paper was a little bit unconvincing at times.  I have come to buy some 
of their conclusions to a degree, but my belief is limited by the great levels 
of uncertainty present.  The very large error bars for a relatively small 
sample size indicate to me that the conclusions drawn are far from the last 
word.  On top of that, going through the past papers this one used as a 
reference, I came to realize that all of the actual analysis done in this paper 
using others' models has errors compounding errors, because each model has its 
own uncertainty and they multiply together when two models are used in 
conjunction.  Specifically addressing each of the conclusions, I think (i) 
and (iii) are useful as long as there are other studies to back them up, but on 
their own they are not conclusive.  I will accept (v) as a legitimate 
challenge to other models, but it does not conclusively disprove them and 
therefore is of little certain value.  I find (ii) to be ambiguous, since 
there is no direct correlation between high metallicity and the presence of WCL 
stars.  What bothers me most about the convincingness of this paper is that 
conclusion (iv) is the most believable, but only because it uses secondary 
evidence to uphold the conclusion - basically, the most believable part of this 
paper is part that wasn't directly intended to be part of the study.  I 
think this indicates that the method being used (i.e. counting WR/O stars from 
models like SV98) is not mature enough yet to draw any firm conclusions.  </p>
<p>d. Informative and surprising<br/>
I suppose what I found most informative was the idea that there is a 
relationship between metallicity and the age of starbursts.  The concept 
that a WR star's life is largely dependent on how much processed nuclear fuel is 
in the region (and therefore in the star) has very important applications, 
though I don't believe it is particularly surprising.  It was interesting 
for me to see how much information is drawn from very few emission lines, and 
the process of eliminating various alternate sources for them.  Nothing in 
the paper was particularly surprising, possibly because I read the paper having 
no previous knowledge of the material that could be upended. </p>
<p>e. Most confusing<br/>
I had to dig pretty deep into other sources to figure out why the WR and O stars 
were being counted in the way that they were, and I still don't have a perfectly 
clear explanation of how that works (see my 'unanswered questions' below).  
I was also very confused by some possible mistakes in the appendix.  A 
"high number of WR stars" and "a high WR/O ratio" were identified for two 
galaxies with ratios of .13 and .09 respectively, while others with .22 and .66 
ratios were not identified as a high ratio.  The identification of one 
galaxy as having .04 being a low ratio is somewhat consistent, but considering 
the difference between 'high' at .09 and 'low' at .04 while there are some with 
ratios as high as .66 seems like a flawed distinction.  Also, for a galaxy 
with WR/O = .05 and a galaxy with WR/O = .66, both were identified as having 
'comparable' numbers of WR and O stars (NGC 5471 and Mrk 309) even though they 
embody the two extremes of WR/O ratios.  </p>
<p>f. Contributions to understanding of WR Galaxies<br/>
The paper provides some evidence confirming the usefulness of a theoretical 
model for starbursts at low metallicities and also calls into question the use 
of that model with the same parameters for higher metallicities.  It raises 
a few questions, but only partially answers the questions it is intended to 
address.  I'm not sure it really contributes anything past the 
identification of WR stars and a little bit of data to feed starburst models; 
perhaps it ties slightly into a larger field of star formation, but I don't 
really see how it would contribute all that much.</p>
<p>g. How might the paper be made better?<br/>
First and foremost, clarifying those few errors I pointed out in section e. 
would be crucial.  It might also be helpful to have more complete numbers 
on the identified spectral lines.  Being a novice in the subject, I would 
have liked a few more brief clarifying statements surrounding some of the lesser 
known terms, but since it is meant to be a higher level technical paper, I 
suppose that is more than I should hope for.  The best thing that could be 
done for this paper would be applying the same techniques to a broader data set, 
but I suppose that's a typical demand and it is often limited by more than just 
the authors' time, but also the observational data available.  </p>

<p>Personal Comments:<br/>
The first few times I read the article, I was fairly confused and had trouble 
comprehending some of the analysis being done, but once I had a better idea of 
what the paper was trying to do and the field it was trying to do it in (from 
reading parts of reference papers), it came together nicely.  There are 
some criticisms that should be leveled at this paper (such as those Dr. Hartigan 
pointed out during my AU presentation), but they probably shouldn't be held to 
too much account - while there were flaws, there was also some legitimate 
science going on, and much of the uncertainty is intrinsic to the technologies 
available to us at this point.  </p>

<p>Questions that still stand unanswered:<br/>
Why are O7v stars really used?  Are they the ONLY O-stars providing 
ionization?  Are they the most prevalent?  Are they just the average 
of other stars and all O-types are assumed to fit a certain statistical 
distribution?</p>
