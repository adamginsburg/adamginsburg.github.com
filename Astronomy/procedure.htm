<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">Observations:</p>
<p align="center">Observations were done with the 16&quot; LX200GPS Schmidt-Cassegrain 
telescope at Rice University.&nbsp; The primary observations were three 
10-minute (600 second) exposures of the Eskimo or Clown Face nebula, NGC 2392.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="center">20 second exposures were taken of the spectrophotometric 
standard star HR3454 and mercury and neon lamps (reflected off of sheets of 
paper).&nbsp; HR3454 is at approximately the same airmass as the Eskimo nebula.</p>
<p align="center">In order to determine the positioning of the spectral images, 
a 5 second exposure of Beta Gemini was taken.</p>
<p align="center">Multiple 600 second, 120 second, and 20 second darks and a 600 
second sky exposure were taken along with multiple flat field images.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">Image Reduction and Analysis:</p>
<p align="center">All .fit images were converted to .imh images for use in IRAF.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="center">Darks were combined using imcombine</p>
<p align="center">Flats were combined using imcombine</p>
<p align="center">The combined dark was subtracted from the primary images and 
the sky image</p>
<p align="center">A 5x5 boxcar smoothing routine was run on the flat image, and 
then the flat was divided by the boxcar flat to get a normalized flat</p>
<p align="center">The sky and primary images were then divided by the normalized 
flat</p>
<p align="center">The primary images were then shifted using imshift so that 
they would be properly aligned (and aligned with the Beta Gemini image)</p>
<p align="center">The final sky was subtracted from the primary images</p>
<p align="center">The primary images were then combined to a final 
two-dimensional spectra of the Eskimo nebula</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">Spectral Analysis:</p>
<p align="center">** The final eskimo nebula image was copied and shifted by 15 and 
35 pixels in order to analyze the inner and outer nebula compositions</p>
<p align="center">Apall was used with an nsum value of 3 to extract 
one-dimensional spectra from the three nebula images using Beta Gemini as a 
reference</p>
<p align="center">The mercury and neon images were combined, then apall was used 
to extract their one-dimensional spectra.&nbsp; The identify function was used 
to identify the mercury and neon spectral lines.&nbsp; The wavelength solution 
from this process was used to apply a dispersion solution to the extracted 
images using the dispcor function.</p>
<p align="center">Apall was used with no referent to extract a one-dimensional 
spectrum of the spectrophotometric standard star HR3454.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="center">The standard task and star HR3454 were used to make a standard 
calibration table, which was subsequently used to fit a calibration function 
using 'sensfunc'.</p>
<p align="center">The function acquired was used to calibrate the extracted, 
dispcor'd images</p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center">Spectra flux measurements:</p>

<p align="center">Using spectool and the 'k' key, the flux of different spectral 
lines were measured</p>
