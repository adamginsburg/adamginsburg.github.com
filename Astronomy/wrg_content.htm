<p align="center"> </p>
<p align="center">I chose to combine the 'content' with the 'analysis' to some 
degree.  I will include specific comments on the content here, and more 
general analysis in the analysis section.</p>
<p align="center">Background information:</p>
<p align="center">Wolf-Rayet stars are massive stars that are very hot and have 
strong stellar winds.  They are believed to be a phase in the evolution of 
very large stars during which the outer hydrogen layers of the star have all 
been blown away by the star's radiation pressure.  The wind causes a 
significant mass loss in the star. They are divided into 3 types: WN, which are 
nitrogen dominant, WC, carbon dominant, and WO, with a Carbon to Oxygen ratio 
less than one (this last category is very rare).  The mass limit on WR 
stars is dependent on metallicity, but all WR stars come from very massive 
progenitors.  </p>
<p align="center">Wolf Rayet galaxies have a significant number of WR stars, 
enough to contribute significantly to the galaxy's spectrum.  They show 
broad emission in the 4686 HeII line and about 1/4 of WRGs show strong NIII 4640 
emission.  Because Wolf-Rayet stars are short-lived, the presence of WR 
features in a galaxy's spectrum indicate both a large number of massive stars 
(with masses greater than 25 solar masses) and a recent burst of star formation 
(begun less than 10 million years ago).  </p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p align="center">Purpose</p>
<p align="center">The paper intended to test the predictions of another paper, 
Schaerer and Vaaca 98, which contained a model of WR/O star populations in 
starburst galaxies.  SV98 predicted that the number of WR stars relative to 
O stars would increase with increasing metallicity (assuming a constant time 
elapsed since the start of the starburst).  The paper also hoped to set 
some constraints on starburst period.  </p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p align="center">Observations</p>
<p align="center">14 Wolf-Rayet Galaxies were observed using the Palomar 200 
inch telescope and the European Southern Observatory New Technology Telescope (ESONTT). 
Long-slit spectra 
(180”) were taken with wavelength coverage 3600-6700 Å for observations using 
the Palomar telescope.  Wavelength coverage was 4000-6600 Å 
for the ESO observations (120”).  Spectral resolution was 5.6-5.7 Å for 
Palomar, 5.9 Å for ESO.  The images were processed using IRAF.  


</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">Analysis</p><p align="center">The absolute 
population of a Wolf-Rayet star subtype was determined using Milky Way Galaxy 
Wolf-Rayet star average luminosity estimates.  The total luminosity of a 
subtype in one of the identified Wolf-Rayet spectral lines divided by the 
absolute luminosity gives a count.  In order to then determine the O-type 
star population, it was assumed that all ionizing photons came from O type 
stars.  The presence of shocks and their associated ionizing photons was 
eliminated by observing low excitation lines and determining that the ratio of 
low-ionized lines (OI, SII, NII) to Hß must be from stellar, not Active Galactic 
Nuclei or Supernova sources.  The total number of ionizing photons was 
measured from Hß emission.  


</p><p align="center">The number of WR stars was determined from measuring Blue Bump 
4686 Å and Red Bump 5808 Å luminosities for WN and WC stars respectively.  
The flux of the blue bump was measured and used to count the number of WN stars 
after nebular contributions were removed.  The blue bump consists of a 
blend of broad Nitrogen, Carbon, and HeII lines.  The dominant contribution 
to the blue bump is the broad HeII 4686 Å line that arises in WN-late type 
stars, while the red bump primarily comes from CIV 5808 Å seen in WC type stars.    
The predominance of WN stars is indicated by the presence of of NIII 4640 Å 
lines and the absence of NV 4604 Å lines.</p><p align="center">WC stars are divided 
into early and late types.  CIII 5696 emission lines are a signature of 
WC-late stars, CIV 5808 Å lines in the absence of 5696 Å lines are an indication 
of the presence of WC-early stars.

<p>Qualms with these results:  All of them show a strong, fairly narrow 
line at FeIII 4658, and all show a strong line at HeII 4686, but there is only a 
clear NIII4640 line in at most half of the diagrams.  Fairall 44, MRK 1271, 
and NGC 450 clearly have no line or a very, very small one at NIII 4640.  
This is a problem because they were able to identify in table 6 that Fairall had 
~700 WNL stars, MRK 1271 had 11, and NGC 450 had about 300.  This is 
especially disturbing for MRK 1271 because it appears to have an absorption 
feature rather than an emission line at the wavelength that is supposed to 
indicate the presence of these stars.  Also, previous papers have 
identified that MRK 1271 may contain a weak broad HeII 4686 feature, but all 
other emission lines were found to be nebular.  However, other sources do 
confirm the presence of broad NIII4640 lines in Fairall 44. </p>
<p>In this spectrum from Izotov and Thuan 98 of MRK 1271 taken with the 2.1m 
telescope at Kitt Peak with about 5 Å angular resolution, shows a very small 
bump around 4650-80 Å, so perhaps this paper is justified in identifying WR 
stars there.  </p>

<p><img border="0" height="411" src="table6.JPG" width="931"/></p>
<p>There are similar issues with UM 48, NGC 4681, and NGC 5471.  As can be 
seen in their spectra, they appear to have no emission line at 4640 Å, but all 
are identified as possessing at least some stars.  NGC 5471 is the 
strangest of these, because they seem to be claiming that they've identified 
2+/-1  Wolf Rayet stars in the spectrum of a galaxy, which seems 
excessively unlikely (though Mas-Hesse and Kunth 99 confirm the presence of the 
emission line at 4650 Å, close to NIII 4640.  Previous studies do not 
identify WR presence, as noted by Schaerer, Contini, and Pindao 99).  
Furthermore, claiming a starburst in a galaxy with &lt;50 massive stars seems like 
a flawed idea.  The source that originally identified NIII 4640 Å lines, 
OC82, may also have been mistaking, but the evidence displayed for the 
identification of WR stars in this galaxy is lacking.  </p>
<p><img border="0" height="654" src="fig7b.JPG" width="861"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>There is also a question as to the reliability of the identification of WC 
stars.  Recall that CIII5696 is a sign of WCL stars and CIV5808 indicates 
the presence of WCE stars.  It seems reasonable that MRK 309 is identified 
as having WCL and not WCE.  However, NGC 4385 is claimed to have 
approximately the same number of WCE and WCL stars, and while there is a visible 
bump at CIII5696, there is no emission line at all at 5808 - it's the flattest 
part of that object's spectrum.  Similar issues arise in any spectra in 
which WCE and WCL stars are both identified (NGC 6764, NGC 7714 A, NGC 4681).  
There is also a typo on CIV 5808, it's written as 5008.  While this fact is 
of little note on its own, it indicates that the paper may have been 
inadequately proofread and/or reviewed before publication.  A last note, 
although there does seem to be a 'broad' bump at CIII5696 for NGC 4861, it is 
accompanied by what appears to be an absorption feature, which may call into 
question the analysis of that bump (i.e. the integrated flux used) and whether 
it deserves to be classed as an emission line. </p>

<p>Continuing the analysis, the number of O stars was determined  using O7v 
type stars.  According to Osterbrock and Cohen 1982, with low levels of 
ionization O7v stars should represent the average.  The ratio of O7v stars 
to total O stars is a parameter dependent on the time elapsed since the 
beginning of the burst.  Both the SV98 model and instantaneous burst models 
were used to calculate the age of the galaxies, and good agreement was reached.  
SV98 was used to calculate the parameter eta-nought, and therefore used to 
calculate the total number of O-stars, which seemed a little strange since that 
is the model that is being tested.  In the table below, eta is the 
parameter just mentioned.  </p>

<p>Results: Number Ratio vs. Metallicity</p>
<p>The solid lines in the graph below are Schaerer and Vacca 98 model 
predictions using different initial mass functions.  The dotted lines are 
Starburst 99 models using different elapsed times.  The paper concluded 
that an extended burst, as opposed to an instantaneous burst, was more likely 
for higher metallicities.  An instantaneous burst model is the best fit for 
lower metallicities (below 12+Log(O/H) = 8.8).  An instantaneous burst 
model with a steeper IMF slope could fit the data, but there is other evidence 
suggesting an extended burst is more likely.</p>
<p><img border="0" height="482" src="fig8.JPG" width="651"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Support for the conclusion of an extended burst comes from the number ratio 
of WC to WN stars.  In this diagram, the solid line is SV98 and the dotted 
line is SGIT 00.  The dash-dot line is a plot of local group ratios 
consistent with constant star formation, and it shows the best agreement.  
The authors caution that the low WC/WN number ratio may be because of some 
mistaken assumptions on CIV emission.  The numbers calculated assume that 
the majority of CIV emission comes from WCE stars, but if that assumption was 
changed to CIV coming from dimmer WCL stars, it would increase the WC/WN ratio 
by a factor of 3-4.  The SV98 model predicts a higher luminosity ratio for 
WCL stars than is observed in this paper.  They argue, then, that a better 
explanation for the low WC/WN ratio is that the starbursts observed are old, and 
therefore WC stars have begun to die off while WN stars are still around.  
Also, some late-type (red) star features have been observed in these high-metallicity 
starburst regions, indicating they're extended bursts of age &lt;7 Myr.  H<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt">ß 
equivalent widths also indicate an extended burst of age &gt;5.3 Myr is likely. 
</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><img border="0" height="414" src="fig9.JPG" width="523"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Pindao et al identify alternative explanations of the WC/WN ratios, 
essentially arguing that various uncertainties make it difficult to say whether 
an extended burst model is necessary or not.  Multiple models of different 
star types are used to calculate the number and number ratios of WR stars, and 
each one contains a large element of uncertainty.  However, piecing 
together the additional facts this paper has observed does suggest than an 
extended burst model would explain the observations.</p>
