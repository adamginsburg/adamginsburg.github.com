<p align="center"> </p>
<p align="center">To determine whether there is a difference in chemical 
composition of the inner and outer portions of the Eskimo nebula.  </p>
<p align="center">The idea for this project came from the fact, as seen in the 
two CCD images displayed on the first page, that there is a difference in 
brightness in the outer portion of the nebula in the Nebular Filtered image and 
the unfiltered image.  Since the nebula filter lets mostly Oxygen spectra 
through, there appeared to be a possibility that there were chemical differences 
rather than just quantitative differences between the inner and outer portions 
of the nebula.  The differences were originally observed using the 
television, not the CCD. </p>
