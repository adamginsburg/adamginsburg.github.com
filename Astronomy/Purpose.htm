<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">To determine whether there is a difference in chemical 
composition of the inner and outer portions of the Eskimo nebula.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="center">The idea for this project came from the fact, as seen in the 
two CCD images displayed on the first page, that there is a difference in 
brightness in the outer portion of the nebula in the Nebular Filtered image and 
the unfiltered image.&nbsp; Since the nebula filter lets mostly Oxygen spectra 
through, there appeared to be a possibility that there were chemical differences 
rather than just quantitative differences between the inner and outer portions 
of the nebula.&nbsp; The differences were originally observed using the 
television, not the CCD. </p>
