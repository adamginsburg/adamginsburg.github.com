    I seek to understand the origin of the stellar mass function and how it is
    influenced by high-mass stars.  This means that I study massive star and
    cluster formation.  High mass stars and clusters are the driving agents of
    feedback throughout the Galaxy, and as such they regulate star formation on
    galactic scales.  I have focused mostly on the early stages of high mass
    cluster formation, trying to understand how and where they form and whether
    the star formation process within these clusters differs from the
    lower-mass star formation seen in the solar neighborhood.

    My work is observational, generally multi-wavelength, including optical,
    near-infrared, millimeter, and radio spectroscopy and imaging.  I develop
    and publicly release tools for processing this data, and all of my reduced
    images are also publicly released.

The center few hundred parsecs of our Galaxy are filled with stars and gas,
especially the dense molecular gas that forms stars.
I have led a <a class="norm"
href="https://github.com/adamginsburg/APEX_CMZ_H2CO">large mapping project</a>
with the <a href="www.apex-telescope.org" class="norm">APEX telescope</a> to
use formaldehyde (H<sub>2</sub>CO) to measure the temperature of the dense,
potentially star-forming gas in the whole CMZ.
We found that gas temperatures are universally high in the densest gas, which
makes this gas very different from the "normal" gas near our solar system.
Usually, dense gas is very cold (&lt;20 K), but in the CMZ is it warm (&gt;50
K), so it must be heated more than "normal" gas.  We concluded that the intense
turbulence throughout CMZ gas is the most likely heat source, beating out
cosmic rays because turbulence can heat variably, while cosmic rays heat more
uniformly.

parsec-resolution map of the volume density of the cloud.  The volume density
of gas - the number of particles per cubic centimeter - is very difficult to
measure, but it is one of the fundamental quantities determining which gas will
form into stars.  We found that the volume density within the forming W51
proto-clusters is &gt;10<sup>5</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup>, showing that these regions
have most of their gas well above normal 'thresholds' for star formation.

<br> The formaldehyde survey lead to the realization that turbulence plays a
major role in the observed line strength for molecular species with a strong
density sensitivity.  "High-density tracers" may be excited even in
"low-density" gas because of the presence of a tail of high-density gas.
A detailed analysis of this process allowed us to make <a
