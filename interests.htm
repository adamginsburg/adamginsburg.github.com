    I am involved in a number of projects to observe the early stages of massive star formation.  
    My work is generally multi-wavelength, including optical, near-infrared, millimeter, and radio
    spectroscopy and imaging.

The region is known as the Central Molecular Zone. While much of the extended emission is due to dense gas laced with molecules, also seen are emission nebulas lit up by massive young stars, glowing supernova remnants, and the curving Galactic Center Radio Arc in purple. The identity and root cause for many other features remains unknown. Besides a massive black hole named Sgr A*, the Galactic Center houses the galaxy's most active star forming region."></a>
    I played an integral role in the

    The BGPS is a 1.1mm survey of the northern Galactic plane using the Bolocam

    2005-2009. It was
    <a href="http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/BOLOCAM_GPS/" class="norm">released to the public via IPAC</a>
    in June 2009. I wrote the
    <a class="norm" href="http://code.google.com/p/bgpspipeline/">data reduction pipeline</a>
    and reduced the data.  I am a coauthor on the first 4 papers from the survey, including 2nd author on the
    <a class="norm" href="http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/BOLOCAM_GPS/bgps_methods.pdf">data paper</a>

    My first accepted paper was a NIR/mm study of the high-mass star forming
    region <a href="iras05358.htm" class="norm">IRAS 05358+3543</a>.  We
    identified additional outflows and suggested that there may be a ~10
    M<sub>O</sub> binary in the system.  At a distance of 1.7 kpc, this object
    is one of the closest and best examples of a hypercompact HII region that
    is likely to be a high-mass star still accreting.  The paper was 
    <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009ApJ...707..310G" class="norm"> published in the Astrophysical Journal </a>.

        class="norm">near-infrared work by Chi-Hung Yan</a>.
    <br>
    <br> I am engaged in ongoing work to follow up this region with Bolocam 1.1mm,
    Herschel far-infrared, and Arecibo, GBT, and eVLA radio measurements.  I believe
    this source will be a promising candidate for ALMA follow-up as well.

    I am studying the W5 and L111 massive star forming complexes in the outer
    galaxy using the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope's HARP heterodyne array and
    the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey.  We have discovered many outflows
    and determined that star formation is occurring in parts of these regions
    previously suspected to be inactive. A group led by John Bally is also
    surveying these regions in molecular hydrogen emission to search for
    outflows.
