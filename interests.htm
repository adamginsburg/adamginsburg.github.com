    I am involved in a number of projects to observe the early stages of massive star formation.  
    My work is generally multi-wavelength, including optical, near-infrared, millimeter, and radio
    spectroscopy and imaging.

    I played an integral role in the <a class="norm"
        href="http://milkyway.colorado.edu/bgps/">Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey
    </a>, which was <a href="http://milkyway.colorado.edu/bgps/"
    class="norm">released to the public via IPAC</a> in June 2009 (I wrote the
    data reduction pipeline and reduced the data).

    My first accepted paper was a NIR/mm study of the high-mass star forming
    region <a href="iras05358.htm" class="norm">IRAS 05358+3543</a>.  We
    identified additional outflows and suggested that there may be a ~10
    M<sub>O</sub> binary in the system.

    I am engaged in ongoing studies of the W5 and L111 massive star forming
    complexes in the outer galaxy and pilot programs to directly measure the
    densities of inner galaxy massive clumps.  I am using the CSO, JCMT, GBT,
    and eVLA for these studies.

    I have also become interested in software development for public use.  My
    personal <a href="software.htm">software page</a> lists some of my
    projects.  I have a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/agpy/"
        class="norm">google code page</a> on which I've released some useful
    codes, the most important being readcol.
    I now participate in <a href="http://aplpy.sourceforge.net/"
        class="norm">APLpy development</a>, working on ds9 region inclusion.
