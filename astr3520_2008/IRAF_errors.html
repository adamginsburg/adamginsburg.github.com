Killing IRAF task `dispcor'
Traceback (innermost last):
  File "<cl cl1="" script="">", line 1, in <module>
IrafError: Error running IRAF task dispcor
IRAF task terminated abnormally
ERROR (1, "NGC7814_44rspec.fits - Missing reference for aperture 2")
</module></cl></pre>
<br/> This error results when you've used a different set of apertures in your 
<a href="apextract/sample_apextraction.html#apall_callamp">calibration lamp extraction </a>
than you used in your <a href="apextract/sample_apextraction.html#apall"> science spectrum
    extraction </a> OR when you haven't <tt>reidentify</tt>'d a cal lamp extraction with
more than one spectrum in it (see step 11 of <a href="apextract/sample_apextraction.html">the 
    aperture extraction example</a>.
<br/>
<br/> If you experienced the former error, you need to go back and re-extract,
then re-identify lines in your cal lamp spectra.  It may be possible to copy
your wavelength solutions: look in database/id[filename], that's where IRAF
stores the wavelength solution.

<br/> <h3> Syntax errors </h3>
If you get an error that includes the word 'syntax', the first thing to check is that 
you've loaded the right package.  For whatever command you're trying to use, run:
<br/><tt> help [command] </tt>
<br/>and look at the name of the command at the top.  It should be something like
<tt>noao.twodspec.apextract.apall</tt>.  Then, run the commands in order:
<br/><tt> noao
    <br/> twodspec
    <br/> apextract </tt>
<br/> and try again.




<!--<br><h3 id="errors"> Instructions for dealing with IRAF errors on cosmos       </h3>
  Since the changeover to the new cosmos server, your login.cl files may be
  incorrect.  They currently have home defined as /raid/home/(username)/etc, but
  this is no longer correct; you will receive errors saying that iraf could not
  modify uparm$(taskname).  You should change this by removing the /raid at the
  front of the path.  This can be done using any <a href="unix_editors.html">editor</a>: look
  for the line "set home = "/raid/home/..." and modify it.  <br>

<br> You can try to re-run mkiraf, which will create a new login.cl for you.
If you had any settings saved in login.cl, it will overwrite them.  You must
also go on and change your imdir to <b>"home$images/"</b>.  Search for the line <b>
#set imtype   "imh"</b> and change it to read <b>set imtype "fits"</b> (remove the # at the beginning of the line).
<br>
<br> If you have trouble with <tt>.imh</tt> files showing up instead of <tt>.fits</tt> files:
<ol> 
    <li>check to see if your imtype is set correctly with <tt>show imtype</tt>.
    <li>if it's <tt>imh</tt>, use <tt>set imtype=fits</tt> to fix it
    <li>you may need to use the <tt>flpr</tt> command to make sure IRAF recognizes the change
    <li>Find your login.cl file.  Make sure the <tt>set imtype=fits</tt> line is uncommented as in <a href="IRAF.html#errors">the directions above</a>.
