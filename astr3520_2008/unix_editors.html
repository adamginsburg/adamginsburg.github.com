<h1><center> ASTR 3520: Introduction to Unix Text Editors</center></h1>
<table align="center" width="800"><tr><td>
<br/> Editing text in unix is different from normal word processing.  In word
processing, you generally are writing for a human audience and constructing
sentences.  You often have the benefit of a spellchecker and a syntax that isn't
too concerned with mistakes (for example, if you have only one space after a
period instead of two, no one is going to mistake your meaning).  In text
editing, however, you are writing for a computer that doesn't speak the same
language, can't correct your spelling all the time, and will become
uncooperative when any mistakes are made.  
<br/>
<br/> One of the most significant differences between word processing and text
editing is that line numbers become significant.  In a word processor, your text
is automatically wrapped to the size of the screen - if you keep typing, it will
automatically start a new line for you.  In text editing and unix command
processing, each line is treated as an independent command, and each line has to
be separated by the enter key (also called a "carriage return" because of what
it did on typewriters).  
<br/>
<br/> For the above reasons, it is convenient to use a different set of tools for
text editing.  The most common tools in unix are <b><a href="http://www.vim.org">vi</a></b> and <b><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">emacs</a></b>, but
these editors have an extremely steep learning curve and will appear completely
unintuitive on first use, perhaps similar to every first experience you have on
unix.  If you don't want to take the time to learn these tools in detail, there
are simple editors that are less powerful and similar to word processors (but
better because they respect the way unix treats lines and formatting).  Two that
are available on the cosmos network are <a href="http://www.nano-editor.org/">nano</a>, which is an updated version
of <a href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pico">pico</a>, and <a href="http://www.nedit.org/">nedit</a>, which is the only graphical
editor listed here (a graphical editor means it is in a different screen from
the xterm you open it in).  All of these can be used on the command line by
simply typing "[editor name] [filename] (&amp;)", e.g. "vi login.cl".  The (&amp;) is if
you want to open it in a different screen, which can only be done with nedit or
the graphical version of vi, called gvim.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/> If you DO want to learn vi, here is a very brief introduction and some links:
<br/> In vi, to edit text, you must be in "insert mode".  This can be achieved by
pressing "i" or "a".  Insert mode is just like being in notepad or nedit; all
you can do is enter and delete and move around in text.  <br/> If you are not in
text mode, you will be in "command mode".  Command mode is much more powerful,
but also incredibly complex.  There are a few essential commands you must know,
and a few that you should be careful about.  First, be careful about pressing
any of these keys: xcsd.  They all delete text in some fashion.  The "u" key
undoes the most recent change.  If you press ":", you enter a command line
within the editing window (you should see a : in the bottom left corner of the
screen).  The most important commands are ":w", which writes your changes (saves
them), and ":q", which quits the program.  ":wq" saves changes and quits.
