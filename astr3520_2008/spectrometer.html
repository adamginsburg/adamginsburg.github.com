                Opening Procedure for the SBO spectrometer:
                <ol><li>Open telescope with normal opening procedure.  Can leave dome closed at start.
                    </li><li>Slew to zenith
                    </li><li>Turn on comp lamps
                    </li><li>Put narrowest slit at focus using the finder.  Move the decker out of the way.
                    </li><li> Power up the spectrograph CCD.  Make sure it is plugged in.  You may have to 
                    unplug the imaging CCD, but make sure it is off first.
                    </li><li> Turn on the leftmost computer.  It is the spectrograph controller.
                    </li><li>Connect CCDSoft to the SBIG ST8 and turn on cooling
                    </li><li>Rotate grating into correct position using vernier scale
                    </li><li>Remove grating cover.
                    </li><li>Expose and focus on HeAr / Ne comp lamp lines.
                    <ol type="a"><li>Collimator focus dial is on the back of the spectrograph structure
                        </li><li> Record focus positions and temperatures
                        </li><li> Save focus files
                    </li></ol>
</li><li>Switch from comparison lamp to sky
                    </li><li>Turn off comparison lamps
                    </li><li>Slew to target
                    </li><li>Find target in eyepiece, adjust to align slit to target
                    <ol type="a"><li> If necessary, rotate turret by loosening
                        the gold knob located ~180 degrees from the eyepiece.
                        Do not over-tighten.</li></ol>

<h3> PICKING YOUR SLIT </h3>
Any slit will do for stellar spectroscopy.  The tradeoffs are resolution and
exposure time.  A wider slit allows more light to pass through it, and
therefore requires less time.  A narrower slit will reduce the blurring caused
by overlapping spectra - think about slitless spectroscopy: if you spread a
continuum over a detector, if there is an image at each wavelength the images
will overlap.  So a narrower slit limits that overlap to the width of the slit
<!--                     <li> ROTATING THE SLIT
                        <br>&nbsp;To rotate the slit angle on the sky, you
                        have to rotate the whole turret.  This requires first
                        loosening the gold knob, then rotating.  The turret is
                        the big white round thing the eyepiece is attached to,
                        the gold knob is located about 180 degrees from
                        the eyepiece.
                        <br>  &nbsp;WARNING: the turret has a lot of wires attached to it.  Don't pull on them too much -->
<h3> COMP LAMPS </h3> 
There are TWO comp lamps: Neon and HeAr.  The Neon lamp
appears orange, the HeAr lamp appears pink.  If both are on, it will be
pinkish-orange.  You can turn the Neon lamp off by unplugging it.  The HeAr
lamp has a power switch on its power cord 

<!--                 A few things to note about the spectrometer:
                 <ol>
                         <li> FOCUSING THE COLLIMATOR
                        <br> Using a narrow slit, take images of the comparison lamp.  You want
                        the spectral lines to be as narrow as possible.  If they are more than
                        a few pixels wide you are not focused.-->
<h3 id="data"> Data from the SBO 24" telescope spectrometer </h3>
To transfer data from the 24" telescope to your home directory, use the program
 "WinSCP".  Login to cosmos.colorado.edu with your normal username and password.
<br/> The software at SBO saves the fits files generated as .fit files.  <a href="http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/~joshw/classes/sbo_fits.html">Josh
		Walawender's solution </a>also changes the stored variable type to
signed (+/-) integer.
<br/> You can also use my <a href="tools/FITtofits.cl">FIT to fits script</a>
