Why am I apolitical?

I am strictly a-political.  That means I don't vote or support a party.

I am not simply lazy.  I am vehemently apolitical.  I don't believe in the
system, and don't support it.  I'm not opposed to democracy, but we don't 
live in a real democracy.  

Voting either way would endorse the candidate, in principle.  More importantly,
it would be an endorsement of a political system in which I have effectively no 
voice, and neither do you.  Money IS influence, so why bother bumping up the
number-of-voter statistics?  

I've been told it's my civic duty to vote, but I don't feel an duty to be an
uninformed voter, and I don't think I've ever met a voter who I felt was
adequately informed.  

It's more important that we question the underlying assumptions of the entire
social, economic, and political system.  It's an observational fact that all
important politicians are wealthy and upper class - even if they hide it by
living small.  However, that isn't necessarily a statement that the poor are
underrepresented, but perhaps that we live in a society in which power and 
money are directly correlated.
