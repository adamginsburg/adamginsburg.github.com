Things I learned in the first 18 months of grad school that they won't tell you
<ol>
    <li> Comps I is the last Friday before classes start.  You will not receive
    any information about it except from your peers.
    <li> Grades matter.  Though the faculty will not, in general, look at the
    letters, they will be aware of your performance in classes and it makes a
    big difference. 
    <li> Comps I is a significantly political process, but your numerical grade
    on the test is still the most important measure of pass/fail.
    <li> NOT EVERYONE PASSES COMPS I.  There are even cases where people have
    failed twice.  The pass rate on a given year varies from 44%-100%, but
    there are also many people who will drop out before comps I and they should
    not count in the "success on comps" category.
