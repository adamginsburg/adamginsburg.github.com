<br> If you've reached this from a google search - it appears as the top choice
given a certain set of search terms - I apologize, it's not really useful unless
you wanted to start a conversation.
<br><br>
<br>Immediately upon completing this book, I decided it was one of 
my favorites.<br> It's a very powerful novel, managing to fit nearly blissful 
joy in the middle of one of the worst living situations in history, whose 
deprivations were certainly the greatest that people were able to survive. 
<br><br>
<br>Perhaps I enjoyed the book so much because of the references 
to other authors and a seeming added development of previous Russian writers, 
Tolstoy, Dostoievsky, and his contemporary Solzhenitsyn.<br> Zhivago seems to 
build on their works, but possibly only because I've read them and can see the 
contrast, which gives it great value in my eyes.<br> 
<br>I found it interesting that nearly no new characters were 
introduced after some midway point in the book.<br> Everyone mentioned by name 
was a character Zhivago had previously encountered or was in some way involved 
with.<br> 
<br>A lot of my reflections come from reading the introduction 
soon after the book.<br> In many Russian novels, maybe just Solzhenitsyn's and 
Pasternak's but probably also Tolstoy's and Dostoievsky's, they seem real and 
accurate because they describe only commonplace encounters with a sometimes 
greater significance.<br> It highlights what is important in peoples' lives.<br> 
In Tolstoy's novels, it was often great balls or grand military encounters.<br> 
In Crime and Punishment, there was a significant and notable dinner scene.<br> 
To both, social occasions were of the utmost importance.<br> In Zhivago, 
though, it is simple conversations and simple meetings rather than the grandiose 
scenes of a wealthy upper class. 
<br>In parts of the book, a first person experience is simulated 
by changing to present tense.<br> This makes the experience feel a little more 
direct without sacrificing any of the... Russian feel of the book.
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br>Words: Supercilious, Hippodrome, Solipsistic (introduction)
<br>Interestingly, I have a strong memory for where on a page and 
even where in a book I recall having seen a passage or word, even if I can't 
remember the passage or word.<br> I knew I wanted to look up hippodrome, but 
couldn't remember the word, so I turned to pages approximately in the area I 
thought it would be, and as luck would have it, found it on the first page I 
checked - 490 - in the bottom left corner, where I knew it would be.
