                 A few things to note about the spectrometer:
                 <ol>
                        <br> <line> 1. FOCUSING THE COLLIMATOR
                        <br> Using a narrow slit, take images of the comparison lamp.  You want
                        the spectral lines to be as narrow as possible.  If they are more than
                        a few pixels wide you are not focused.
                        <line><br> 2. PICKING YOUR SLIT
                        <br> Any slit will do for stellar spectroscopy.  The tradeoffs are
                        resolution and exposure time.  A wider slit allows more light to pass
                        through it, and therefore requires less time.  A narrower slit will 
                        reduce the blurring caused by overlapping spectra - think about slitless 
                        spectroscopy: if you spread a continuum over a detector, if there is an
                        image at each wavelength the images will overlap.  So a narrower slit 
                        limits that overlap to the width of the slit
                     <line><br>3. ROTATING THE SLIT
                        <br>&nbsp;To rotate the slit angle on the sky, you
                        have to rotate the whole turret.  This requires first
                        loosening the gold knob, then rotating.  The turret is
                        the big white round thing the eyepiece is attached to,
                        the gold knob is located about 180 degrees from
                        the eyepiece.
                        <br>  &nbsp;WARNING: the turret has a lot of wires attached to it.  Don't pull on them too much
                        <line><br>4. COMP LAMPS 
                        <br> &nbsp; There are TWO comp
                        lamps: Neon and HeAr.  The Neon lamp appears orange, the
                        HeAr lamp appears pink.  If both are on, it will be
                        pinkish-orange.  You can turn the Neon lamp off by
                        unplugging it.  The HeAr lamp has a power switch on its
                        power cord
