<br/><h3 id="errors"> Instructions for dealing with IRAF errors on cosmos       </h3>
  Since the changeover to the new cosmos server, your login.cl files may be
  incorrect.  They currently have home defined as /raid/home/(username)/etc, but
  this is no longer correct; you will receive errors saying that iraf could not
  modify uparm$(taskname).  You should change this by removing the /raid at the
  front of the path.  This can be done using any <a href="unix_editors.html">editor</a>: look
  for the line "set home = "/raid/home/..." and modify it.  <br/>
<br/> You can try to re-run mkiraf, which will create a new login.cl for you.
If you had any settings saved in login.cl, it will overwrite them.  You must
also go on and change your imdir to <b>"home$images/"</b>.  Search for the line <b>
#set imtype   "imh"</b> and change it to read <b>set imtype "fits"</b> (remove the # at the beginning of the line).
<br/>
<br/> If you have trouble with <tt>.imh</tt> files showing up instead of <tt>.fits</tt> files:
<ol>
<li>check to see if your imtype is set correctly with <tt>show imtype</tt>.
    </li><li>if it's <tt>imh</tt>, use <tt>set imtype=fits</tt> to fix it
    </li><li>you may need to use the <tt>flpr</tt> command to make sure IRAF recognizes the change
    </li><li>Find your login.cl file.  Make sure the <tt>set imtype=fits</tt> line is uncommented as in <a href="IRAF.html#errors">the directions above</a>.
</li></ol>
<br/><h3 id="quicktips"> IRAF quick tips</h3>
-If you see errors that involve "uparm" or "unable to write...":
<br/> -try to <b>logout</b> of the cl and log back in; make sure you're in the directory with your login.cl file
<br/> -make sure your login.cl has been edited as per <a href="IRAF.html#errors">the directions above</a>
<br/>
<br/>-If you have problems with <b>imexam</b> and cursor behavior:
<br/> -restart DS9, try again
<br/> -restart DS9, <b>logout</b> of the cl and log back in
<br/> -get frustrated, call or <a href="mailto:adam.ginsburg@colorado.edu">e-mail</a> Adam, see if he gets frustrated
<br/>
<br/>-Using IRAF graphics terminals:
<br/> -q quits; a quit and re-enter solves most problems
<br/> -? displays help in the terminal.  Don't forget to quit out of the help when you're done
<br/> -:(command) allows "colon commands" that can be quite powerful (see, e.g., "wcs" in <b>imexam</b>)
<br/>
<br/>-A <tt>syntax error</tt> in IRAF generally means you have not loaded the requisite package.
<br/>  -if you don't know what package that is, use the <tt>help</tt> command (e.g. <tt>help temden</tt>)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/> <h3 id="guider"> Matching Guider Images to Science Images </h3>
 Instead of going through each individual file's header, I recommend using this command:
<br/> <tt>imhead proc-*.fits[0] lo+ | grep -E "Pixel\ file\|UTTIME"</tt>
<br/> in the <tt>ecam</tt> directory, and the command 
<br/> <tt>imhead e*.fits lo+ | grep -E "Pixel\ file\|UTC-OBS"</tt>
<br/> in the science directory for the selected night in order to list the file
names and exposure start times for each file.  You can then write the output of
these commands to a file by appening a redirect to the
end of the command, e.g. <br/><tt> imhead e*.fits lo+ | grep -E "Pixel\ file\|UTC-OBS" &gt; filename.txt </tt>.  
<br/> Once you have found the necessary files, copy them to your directory.  
<br/> If you are using DIS instead of Echelle, replace <tt>e*.fits</tt> with <tt>d*.fits</tt>.
<br/>
<br/> <h5>If you're curious about what those commands mean, read on.</h5>  You should already be familiar with the imhead command, which with the <tt>long</tt>
option enabled prints the full header.  The <tt>[0]</tt> appended to the end of
the filename chooses the first extension in the fits image.  A fits file is
capable of holding many extensions, i.e. many images, in one file.  In the case
of the Echelle guider camera, the proc-[something].fits files have the slit
superimposed on the sky image as the first extension, and the slit mask image as
the second extension.  
<br/> The grep command outputs all lines containing a regular expression from its input.  A regular expression is a special pattern matching expression.
In this case, we have <tt>"Pixel\ file\|UTC-OBS"</tt>, which means we are searching for lines with the string <tt>Pixel file</tt> or <tt>UTC-OBS</tt>.
The backslash before the space <a href="http://xkcd.com/234/">escapes</a> the space so that IRAF doesn't think you are giving it another command.  Similarly,
we must escape the or operator | (though I'm not entirely certain why - this is not standard behavior).  The -E option tells grep that we are using 
an extended regular expression, which is what allows the use of the | symbol.
