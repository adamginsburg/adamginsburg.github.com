<td>  This near-infrared image was taken in the narrow-band emission line
            [Fe II] 1.64 microns, i.e. an iron emission line in the near-infrared part of
            the spectrum.  A coronagraph (a piece of metal to block out light
            from the central star) was used because P Cygni is a lot brighter than its
            circumstellar nebula.  To make the picture, we rotated the camera to three
            different position angles and averaged them.  The funny-looking lines are
            artifacts from the presence of the coronagraph as an empty space in the 
            images.
            <br/> This nebula was ejected from the star in an eruption that was
            probably in 1600.
