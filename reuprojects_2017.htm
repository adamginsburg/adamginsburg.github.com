<h3> Determine how much mass is ejected in a high-mass outflow </h3>

Goal: Measure the CO/H ratio across a symmetric high-mass outflow.
Provide a fundamental calibration for outflow mass-loading rates.

<br>
Completed by Terry Melo

<br><br>
One of the fundamental problems affecting observations of molecular gas
is that we don't know precisely how much of each molecule there is
relative to the total amount of mass (or the total amount of hydrogen,
since it's mostly hydrogen).  This outflow, known as the "Lacy Jet"
for its discoverer, is unique in that it is (almost) perfectly symmetric,
but one half is molecular and the other half is ionized.  Because
we can measure the hydrogen mass directly in an ionized medium, we
should be able to measure the CO abundance directly in this outflow.
The project should involve a relatively straightforward measurement
followed by an examination of the possible confusing effects that
might impact the measurement.

<br><br>
The student will learn about molecular abundances and protostellar outflows.
They will be trained to use interpolation and reprojection algorithms to match
datasets on different grids.
The project is based on data from ALMA, the VLA, and the IRTF.

<h3> Cataloging clouds in the Central Molecular Zone </h3>

Goal: Create an improved catalog of molecular clouds as seen in 13CO from the
<a class=norm href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/APEX-CMZ-1mm">APEX CMZ
survey</a>.  

<br><br>
While the CMZ is very well-observed, there is no definitive cloud catalog made from
a velocity-resolved data cube.  Such a catalog provides the necessary framework
for discussing individual cloud properties and for comparing different data sets.

<br><br>
This project will use the <a class=norm href="http://dendrograms.org/">astrodendro</a>
package for cataloging.  The catalog will be examined (using <a class=norm
    href="http://glueviz.org/en/stable/">glue</a>) to determine what the most
robust and reliable parameters are.

<br><br>
The student will learn about structure identification in images, the dynamics
and structure of molecular clouds, and the center of our Galaxy.
These data sets already exist in reduced form, so the student will not need
to do any data reduction work.

<h3> Geometry of Molecular Clouds in the CMZ </h3>
<br>
Goal: Determine the geometry of the clouds
using the method demonstrated in <a
    class=norm href="http://esoads.eso.org/abs/2015A%26A...573A.106G"> Ginsburg+ 2015 (fig
9)</a> and figure out how far the clouds are from the central black hole.  

<br>
Part of Natalie Butterfield's PhD thesis

<br> <br>
While improved models of the CMZ's geometry have recently been developed (<a
href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ApJ...735L..33M" class=norm>1</a>,<a
href="http://esoads.eso.org/abs/2015MNRAS.447.1059K" class=norm>2</a>),
we still know little about where exactly the clouds are relative to the central
black hole and one another.  This geometric information is crucial for understanding
the physical properties and evolutionary sequence of clouds in the CMZ.
<br><br>
The basic method is to compare H<sub>2</sub>CO absorption with <sup>13</sup>CO
emission in position-velocity cubes over regions where we know that HII regions
are present in the CMZ along the line of sight.  By comparing the emission and
absorption, we can determine which clouds are in the foreground or background
of the HII regions and therefore where along the "CMZ Ring" they lay.

<br><br>

This project will use ATCA, GBT, and VLA data sets that are already reduced.
The analysis will be primarily visual, using ds9 and glue to compare the
images.  
The student will learn these visualization tools and the details of the CMZ's
layout.
