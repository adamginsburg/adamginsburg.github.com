            <h3> Cataloging clouds in the Central Molecular Zone </h3>

Goal: Create an improved catalog of molecular clouds as seen in 13CO from the
<a class=norm href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/APEX-CMZ-1mm">APEX CMZ
survey</a>.  
This project will use the <a class=norm href="http://dendrograms.org/">astrodendro</a>
package for cataloging.  The catalog will be examined (using <a class=norm
    href="http://glueviz.org/en/stable/">glue</a>) to determine what the most
robust and reliable parameters are.

<br> Time permitting, with the catalog in hand, determine the geometry of the clouds
using the method demonstrated in <a
    class=norm href="http://esoads.eso.org/abs/2015A%26A...573A.106G"> Ginsburg+ 2015 (fig
9)</a> and figure out how far the clouds are from the central black hole.

<h3> Determine how much mass is ejected in a high-mass outflow </h3>

Goal: Measure the CO/H ratio across a symmetric high-mass outflow.
Provide a fundamental calibration for outflow mass-loading rates.

One of the fundamental problems affecting observations of molecular gas
is that we don't know precisely how much of each molecule there is
relative to the total amount of mass (or the total amount of hydrogen,
since it's mostly hydrogen).  This outflow, known as the "Lacy Jet"
for its discoverer, is unique in that it is (almost) perfectly symmetric,
but one half is molecular and the other half is ionized.  Because
we can measure the hydrogen mass directly in an ionized medium, we
should be able to measure the CO abundance directly in this outflow.
The project should involve a relatively straightforward measurement
followed by an examination of the possible confusing effects that
might impact the measurement.
