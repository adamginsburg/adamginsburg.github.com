<h3> Measure the Kinematic Structure of Sgr B2, the most massive cloud in our galaxy</h3>


Molecular clouds are the regions in which stars form, and they are turbulent.
This project aims to measure the kinematic structure (the velocity of
difference gas blobs) of the most massive cloud in our Galaxy.  The student
will use the <a class=norm
href="https://github.com/jdhenshaw/scousepy">SCOUSE</a> software to fit
spectral profiles to millions of spectra semi-automatically.  Because SCOUSE is
new and experimental software,
this project will involve some software debugging and development.
The end result should be an essential measurement of the velocity field
and turbulent statistics in a very massive cloud, which will serve as the key
measurement in a paper testing theoretical models of star formation. 

This project will be done in collaboration with Jonny Henshaw, who
developed SCOUSE.

<h3> Search for hypercompact HII regions in the MGPS </h3>

The <a href="https://github.com/keflavich/MGPS" class=norm>MUSTANG Galactic
Plane Survey (MGPS)</a> is creating the first 3mm continuum
map of a large fraction of the Galactic plane.  With 10 arcsecond resolution
and few millijansky sensitivity, it can detect the youngest massive stars in
the Galaxy.  This project will involve cataloging the continuum images from
MGPS using astrodendro or a related code, then cross-matching the catalog with
other radio sources catalogs to identify millimeter-bright sources that are
either undetected or faint at other wavelengths.  This will be the first
catalog of extremely young, accreting O/B stars in our Galaxy.

<h3> Cataloging clouds in the Central Molecular Zone </h3>

Goal: Create an improved catalog of molecular clouds as seen in <sup>13</sup>CO from the
<a class=norm href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/APEX-CMZ-1mm">APEX CMZ
survey</a>.  

<br><br>
While the CMZ is very well-observed, there is no definitive cloud catalog made from
a velocity-resolved data cube.  Such a catalog provides the necessary framework
for discussing individual cloud properties and for comparing different data sets.

<br><br>
This project will use the <a class=norm href="http://dendrograms.org/">astrodendro</a>
package for cataloging.  The catalog will be examined (using <a class=norm
    href="http://glueviz.org/en/stable/">glue</a>) to determine what the most
robust and reliable parameters are.

<br><br>
The student will learn about structure identification in images, the dynamics
and structure of molecular clouds, and the center of our Galaxy.
These data sets already exist in reduced form, so the student will not need
to do any data reduction work.

<h3>Implement a CASA region parser in astropy </h3>

Completed by GSoC student Sushobhana Patra.
<a class=norm href="https://astropy-regions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/crtf.html">CRTF Documentation</a>
<br>

CASA is the main data reduction package for ALMA and VLA data.   Regions on the
sky such as ellipses, circles, and boxes can be specified in a few different
formats.  CASA has a region format that is currently supported only by CASA
itself, but it will be helpful for researchers to be able to translate these
regions to other formats.  Astropy is a general-use library for astronomy
written in python, and it includes a package for handling sky regions.  The
student will write a CASA region parser for the astropy regions project.  They
will gain familiarity both with CASA and astropy.  Some experience with python
or similar scripted languages is required.  This is primarily a software
development project and therefore may be of interest to a broader range of
students.

<h3> Measure the protostellar population in the W51 star forming region</h3>

Completed by Connor McClellan (U. Florida).
<a href="https://github.com/cmcclellan1010/nrao" class=norm>Summer Project Repository</a>
and associated <a href="http://dendrocat.readthedocs.org/" class=norm>software package</a>
<br>


High-mass star-cluster-forming regions are the most active areas of star
formation in the Galaxy and may have been the dominant path for star formation
in the early universe.  The W51 protocluster region is one of the closest and
most massive in our Galaxy.  While the high-mass stars have been identified and
measured with ALMA and VLA data, there are abundant lower-mass (but still
possibly massive) stars in the surroundings that have only recently been
discovered with very high resolution data.  These objects need to be cataloged,
characterized, and described.  The student will examine VLA and ALMA images
with resolution ~0.05" and look at source spectra to determine the protostars'
luminosities and, ideally, masses.  The student will learn to use astropy tools
for source finding, Gaussian fitting, and spectroscopic analysis.

    <h3>Protostars in Orion: Spectral Energy Distributions and proper motions </h3>

    Completed by Justin Otter (U. Haverford). <a href="https://github.com/jaotter/summer_research_2018" class=norm>Summer research repository</a>
    <br>

The Orion nebula is adjacent to the closest high-mass star-forming region in
the Galaxy.  New ALMA data have revealed several new sources in this region
that are likely to be protostars.  We would like to measure their positions and
luminosities and determine what sorts of protostars they are.  Learning about
these stars and their motions will tell us what the gravitational potential of
the Orion cluster looks like and will be important for determining how
high-mass stars have formed there.  The student will examine VLA and ALMA
images with resolution ~0.05" and look at source spectra to determine the
protostars' luminosities and, ideally, masses.  The student will learn to use
astropy tools for source finding, Gaussian fitting, and spectroscopic analysis.
The student will also have opportunities to look at the VLA archive and attempt
to reduce archival data if they have the time and ambition.

<h3> Determine how much mass is ejected in a high-mass outflow </h3>

Completed by Terry Melo (Agnes Scott College).  <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2018AAS...23113615M/abstract" class=norm>Presented at AAS</a>
<br>
<br>

Goal: Measure the CO/H ratio across a symmetric high-mass outflow.
Provide a fundamental calibration for outflow mass-loading rates.


<br><br>
One of the fundamental problems affecting observations of molecular gas
is that we don't know precisely how much of each molecule there is
relative to the total amount of mass (or the total amount of hydrogen,
since it's mostly hydrogen).  This outflow, known as the "Lacy Jet"
for its discoverer, is unique in that it is (almost) perfectly symmetric,
but one half is molecular and the other half is ionized.  Because
we can measure the hydrogen mass directly in an ionized medium, we
should be able to measure the CO abundance directly in this outflow.
The project should involve a relatively straightforward measurement
followed by an examination of the possible confusing effects that
might impact the measurement.

<br><br>
The student will learn about molecular abundances and protostellar outflows.
They will be trained to use interpolation and reprojection algorithms to match
datasets on different grids.
The project is based on data from ALMA, the VLA, and the IRTF.

<h3> Geometry of Molecular Clouds in the CMZ </h3>
Part of Natalie Butterfield's PhD thesis (U. Iowa)
<br>
<br>
Goal: Determine the geometry of the clouds
using the method demonstrated in <a
    class=norm href="http://esoads.eso.org/abs/2015A%26A...573A.106G"> Ginsburg+ 2015 (fig
9)</a> and figure out how far the clouds are from the central black hole.  


<br> <br>
While improved models of the CMZ's geometry have recently been developed (<a
href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ApJ...735L..33M" class=norm>1</a>,<a
href="http://esoads.eso.org/abs/2015MNRAS.447.1059K" class=norm>2</a>),
we still know little about where exactly the clouds are relative to the central
black hole and one another.  This geometric information is crucial for understanding
the physical properties and evolutionary sequence of clouds in the CMZ.
<br><br>
The basic method is to compare H<sub>2</sub>CO absorption with <sup>13</sup>CO
emission in position-velocity cubes over regions where we know that HII regions
are present in the CMZ along the line of sight.  By comparing the emission and
absorption, we can determine which clouds are in the foreground or background
of the HII regions and therefore where along the "CMZ Ring" they lay.

<br><br>

This project will use ATCA, GBT, and VLA data sets that are already reduced.
The analysis will be primarily visual, using ds9 and glue to compare the
images.  
The student will learn these visualization tools and the details of the CMZ's
layout.
