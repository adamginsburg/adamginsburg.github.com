<h3> Line Radiative Transfer Modeling: What effect does turbulence have on observed lines? </h3>
Much of what we know of the interstellar medium and of star formation derives
from properties we measure using spectral line intensities and line ratios.
The standard tools for interpreting lines and line ratios are <b>local
thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE)</b> models and <b>large velocity gradient (LVG)</b>
models.  In both cases, the radiative excitation and transfer is simplified
to a <i>one-zone models</i> that reduce the entire line of sight to a single
assumed state.  This assumption is wrong (e.g., <a
    href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...835..217L/abstract"
    class=norm>Leroy+ 2017</a>).

To solve this, we will apply radiative transfer models using both LTE and LVG
to individual cells in a simulation, but will then do ray-tracing radiative transfer
through different viewing angles to see what the effects of varying optical
depth and excitation are.  This will be done using <a class=norm
href="https://www.ita.uni-heidelberg.de/~dullemond/software/radmc-3d/">RADMC-3D</a>,
and the initial simulations used will be the <a href="https://www.mhdturbulence.com/" class=norm>CATS</a>
database.  We will post-process these simulations to produce synthetic line emission maps,
and we will analyze them as if the whole simulation box were a single zone.  
We will derive a mapping from the simulation physical conditions (linewidth,
moments of the density, column density, and velocity fields, etc) to line ratios
and determine whether they follow a trend that will allow inversion of line ratio
to inferred physical properties.  This work will also produce, as a side effect,
synthetic image for other types of analysis.

<h3> Radio Continuum Imaging & Measurement for the ALMA-IMF project </h3>
The ALMA-IMF program is a large project to survey to image high-mass star
forming regions and count the number of forming new stars of each mass.  This
measurement of the proto-initial-mass-function (proto-IMF, sometimes core mass
function, CMF) is one of the two key ingredients of star formation theory, and
if we find environmental variation, it will have profound impact on application
of these models in the context of both simulations and extragalactic
observations.  This sub-project is to measure the "free-free contamination" in
our millimeter continuum observations to help get accurate masses toward the
highest-mass stars.  It will involve imaging radio continuum data from the
JVLA, and maybe poking at those same data sets to look for some interesting
lines.

<h3> Archival Research: Catalog of "core" catalogs </h3>
Several surveys of pre- and proto-stellar cores have been created, including
dozens of local clouds using single-dish instruments and rapidly growing
numbers of Galactic Disk clouds with ALMA.
This project will be to assemble a table of these catalogs and determine
whether they can be drawn from the same parent distribution, or not.
If they cannot, that may indicate that the star formation process differs in these
environments.  If they can, the data hint at a universal star formation process.
The key difficulty in this project is to determine how the catalogs are made
and how much of the inevitable differences come from observational effects rather
than physical effects.

        <h3>Salt mining in Chile's high desert</h3>
We found salt (NaCl and KCl) in the disks around Orion's Source I and another
disk.  Are there more salt detections waiting to be extracted from existing
data in the ALMA archive?  Each detection is likely to result in a dynamical
mass measurement of the central source.  Together, these detections might tell
us more about the physical conditions that allow gas-phase salts to exist
around protostars.

<h3> Measure the protostellar population in the W51 star forming region: Part II </h3>


High-mass star-cluster-forming regions are the most active areas of star
formation in the Galaxy and may have been the dominant path for star formation
in the early universe.  The W51 protocluster region is one of the closest and
most massive in our Galaxy.  While the high-mass stars have been identified and
measured with ALMA and VLA data, there are abundant lower-mass (but still
possibly massive) stars in the surroundings that have only recently been
discovered with very high resolution data.  These objects need to be cataloged,
characterized, and described.  This detailed characterization will be used as
the 'calibration' for our analysis of a large data set in the ALMA-IMF program.
We will also look for binaries and attempt to characterize the binary distribution
function at our ~300 AU resolution.

Previously, as part of a student project, a cataloging tool was developed and applied
to one set of ALMA images.  For this project, we need to take these existing catalogs
and cross-match them to measure a few key quantities, including the source multiplicity
as a function of resolution and source temperature.

This is a follow-up of another project completed by Connor McClellan (U. Florida).

<h3> Cataloging clouds in the Central Molecular Zone </h3>

[This project is partially completed by Dario Colombo at MPIfR with a competing
dataset.  If it sounds interesting, there is a lot more that can be done, but
we need to negotiatie first.]

Goal: Create an improved catalog of molecular clouds as seen in <sup>13</sup>CO from the
<a class=norm href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/APEX-CMZ-1mm">APEX CMZ
survey</a>.  

<br><br>
While the CMZ is very well-observed, there is no definitive cloud catalog made from
a velocity-resolved data cube.  Such a catalog provides the necessary framework
for discussing individual cloud properties and for comparing different data sets.

<br><br>
This project will use the <a class=norm href="http://dendrograms.org/">astrodendro</a>
package, possibly with <a class=norm href="http://esoads.eso.org/abs/2015MNRAS.454.2067C">SCIMES</a>,
for cataloging.  The catalog will be examined
(using <a class=norm href="http://glueviz.org/en/stable/">glue</a>) to
determine what the most robust and reliable parameters are.

<br><br>
The student will learn about structure identification in images, the dynamics
and structure of molecular clouds, and the center of our Galaxy.
These data sets already exist in reduced form, so the student will not need
to do any data reduction work.

<h3>Which lines trace what processes in the Galactic Center?</h3>

UF Graduate Student Alyssa Bulatek is leading this project.<br>

There are a lot of molecular species that trace the entire "Central Molecular
Zone" that are not seen in molecular clouds in the solar neighborhood.  Some of
these, like HNCO and SiO, are typically considered "shock tracers" when
observed locally, but they are observed to be ubiquitous in the CMZ, so they're
not useful for tracing high-velocity (protostellar jet, for example) material.
I have a large ALMA program (not an ALMA large program...) to perform a full
spectral line survey of one line of sight through the CMZ that includes diffuse
gas, dense gas, molecular cores, and protostellar outflows, and our goal is to
determine which molecular species, if any, uniquely trace one of these physical
features.  Data are being taken in Cycle 7 (Oct. 2019 - Sep. 2020); the Band 3, 4, and 6
components are mostly complete.

<h3> Measure the protostellar population in Galactic Center cloud Sgr B2 DS</h3>

UF Graduate Student Desmond Jeff is leading this project.<br>

How is star formation in the Galactic center different from the Galactic disk?
We have a pretty good idea that it is (see, e.g., 
<a class=norm href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.429..987L">Longmore+ 2013</a>
and references thereto), but why?  Sgr B2 is the only richly star-forming cloud
in the Galactic center, and I have been leading star-counting measurements
of its ongoing star formation.

In <a class=norm href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...853..171G">Ginsburg+ 2018</a>,
I discovered a large population of protostars that I asserted were all
high-mass.  About half of them are distributed along an elongated, possibly
filamentary string in the "Deep South" subregion of the Sgr B2 molecular cloud.
I obtained high-sensitivity and high-resolution data at 1 mm to measure these
sources more accurately and search for their purported low-mass counterparts.
The data are extremely rich, so there are several projects here:
<ol>
    <li> Catalog the continuum sources at 0.5" and 0.1" resolution.  Compare the catalog
        to the existing 3 mm continuum 0.5" resolution data.  Determine what the sources
        are and whether the IMF extrapolations of Ginsburg+ 2018 were correct.  Characterize
        the source multiplicity on the observed 4000 and 1000 AU scales.
    <li> Catalog and measure the outflows in Sgr B2 DS.  Quick look imaging revealed at least
        a dozen SiO J=5-4 bipolar outflows.  We need to compare these outflows to Galactic disk and
        other Galactic center outflows.  We will also search for other molecular tracers of outflow
        within the same data set.  We will infer source luminosities and perhaps accretion rates
        from these measurements.

<h3> Measure the Kinematic Structure of Sgr B2, the most massive cloud in our galaxy</h3>

UF Undergraduate Madeline Hall is working on this project.

Molecular clouds are the regions in which stars form, and they are turbulent.
This project aims to measure the kinematic structure (the velocity of
difference gas blobs) of the most massive cloud in our Galaxy.  The student
will use the <a class=norm
href="https://github.com/jdhenshaw/scousepy">SCOUSE</a> software to fit
spectral profiles to millions of spectra semi-automatically.  Because SCOUSE is
new and experimental software,
this project will involve some software debugging and development.
The end result should be an essential measurement of the velocity field
and turbulent statistics in a very massive cloud, which will serve as the key
measurement in a paper testing theoretical models of star formation. 

This project will be done in collaboration with Jonny Henshaw, who
developed SCOUSE.

        <h3> Ammonia masers in W51 </h3>
        UF Undergraduate Derod Deal is working on this project.

        Ammonia masers are a very rare astronomical phenomenon.  They have been
        detected toward only a handful of sources, including W51 IRS2, in which
        there are dozens of different masing transitions.  I have obtained new
        high spatial resolution (0.04-0.1 arcsecond, 200-500 AU) data with the
        VLA with the goal of determining exactly where these masers come from
        and which source(s) drive them.  This project will involve comparison
        between the VLA data and similar high-resolution data sets from ALMA.

<h3>Implement a CASA region parser in astropy </h3>

Completed by GSoC student Sushobhana Patra.
<a class=norm href="https://astropy-regions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/crtf.html">CRTF Documentation</a>
<br>

CASA is the main data reduction package for ALMA and VLA data.   Regions on the
sky such as ellipses, circles, and boxes can be specified in a few different
formats.  CASA has a region format that is currently supported only by CASA
itself, but it will be helpful for researchers to be able to translate these
regions to other formats.  Astropy is a general-use library for astronomy
written in python, and it includes a package for handling sky regions.  The
student will write a CASA region parser for the astropy regions project.  They
will gain familiarity both with CASA and astropy.  Some experience with python
or similar scripted languages is required.  This is primarily a software
development project and therefore may be of interest to a broader range of
students.

    <h3>Protostars in Orion: Spectral Energy Distributions and proper motions </h3>

    Completed by Justin Otter (Haverford College). <a href="https://github.com/jaotter/summer_research_2018" class=norm>Summer research repository</a>
    <br>

The Orion nebula is adjacent to the closest high-mass star-forming region in
the Galaxy.  New ALMA data have revealed several new sources in this region
that are likely to be protostars.  We would like to measure their positions and
luminosities and determine what sorts of protostars they are.  Learning about
these stars and their motions will tell us what the gravitational potential of
the Orion cluster looks like and will be important for determining how
high-mass stars have formed there.  The student will examine VLA and ALMA
images with resolution ~0.05" and look at source spectra to determine the
protostars' luminosities and, ideally, masses.  The student will learn to use
astropy tools for source finding, Gaussian fitting, and spectroscopic analysis.
The student will also have opportunities to look at the VLA archive and attempt
to reduce archival data if they have the time and ambition.

<h3> Determine how much mass is ejected in a high-mass outflow </h3>

Completed by Terry Melo (Agnes Scott College).  <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2018AAS...23113615M/abstract" class=norm>Presented at AAS</a>
<br>
<br>

Goal: Measure the CO/H ratio across a symmetric high-mass outflow.
Provide a fundamental calibration for outflow mass-loading rates.


<br><br>
One of the fundamental problems affecting observations of molecular gas
is that we don't know precisely how much of each molecule there is
relative to the total amount of mass (or the total amount of hydrogen,
since it's mostly hydrogen).  This outflow, known as the "Lacy Jet"
for its discoverer, is unique in that it is (almost) perfectly symmetric,
but one half is molecular and the other half is ionized.  Because
we can measure the hydrogen mass directly in an ionized medium, we
should be able to measure the CO abundance directly in this outflow.
The project should involve a relatively straightforward measurement
followed by an examination of the possible confusing effects that
might impact the measurement.

<br><br>
The student will learn about molecular abundances and protostellar outflows.
They will be trained to use interpolation and reprojection algorithms to match
datasets on different grids.
The project is based on data from ALMA, the VLA, and the IRTF.

<h3> Geometry of Molecular Clouds in the CMZ </h3>
Part of Natalie Butterfield's PhD thesis (U. Iowa)
<br>
<br>
Goal: Determine the geometry of the clouds
using the method demonstrated in <a
    class=norm href="http://esoads.eso.org/abs/2015A%26A...573A.106G"> Ginsburg+ 2015 (fig
9)</a> and figure out how far the clouds are from the central black hole.  


<br> <br>
While improved models of the CMZ's geometry have recently been developed (<a
href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ApJ...735L..33M" class=norm>1</a>,<a
href="http://esoads.eso.org/abs/2015MNRAS.447.1059K" class=norm>2</a>),
we still know little about where exactly the clouds are relative to the central
black hole and one another.  This geometric information is crucial for understanding
the physical properties and evolutionary sequence of clouds in the CMZ.
<br><br>
The basic method is to compare H<sub>2</sub>CO absorption with <sup>13</sup>CO
emission in position-velocity cubes over regions where we know that HII regions
are present in the CMZ along the line of sight.  By comparing the emission and
absorption, we can determine which clouds are in the foreground or background
of the HII regions and therefore where along the "CMZ Ring" they lay.

<br><br>

This project will use ATCA, GBT, and VLA data sets that are already reduced.
The analysis will be primarily visual, using ds9 and glue to compare the
images.  
The student will learn these visualization tools and the details of the CMZ's
layout.
