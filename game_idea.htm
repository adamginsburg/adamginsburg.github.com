<center><h2>Game Idea</h2>
<table align="center" width=800><tr><td>
    I envision a game that would involve attempting to re-create images of nebula with a variety of interesting
    structures by placing a variety of object types at different positions on a grid.  The resultant image could
    then be subtracted from a smoothed version of a real astronomical image and a score given based on the 
    quality of fit.
    <br>
    <br> The game could be modeled on [flash game link] in terms of visualization.  It would require some flashy
    - rather than realistic - graphics, a simple interface (possibly with the option of an advanced interface), 
    and a scoring system in order to gather public interest.
    <br>
    <br> To achieve useful science results, a rather advanced physics engine would have to be used.  Games with
    simple gravitational potential have already been made, but this would require fluid-dynamical
    interactions.  Stellar winds, jets, and radiation field would all be factors, and could be the three main
    parameters the users could play with.
    <br>
    <br> Two item types could be place on the "grid" that would be made: jets and stars.  Jets would have properties
    of speed, age (length), direction, and mass/mass loss rate.  Stars could have properties of mass and luminosity.  The ambient
    radiation field, as the third parameter, would have a direction and would simulate a bright, hot
    source outside of the field.  Ambient nebular density could also be a parameter.
    <br>
    <br> The combination of radiation field and ambient nebula with shocks and winds would generate shocks
    and ionization fronts of various shapes.
    <br>
    <br> In the "advanced" mode, all of these parameters could be modified, but to make the game interesting
    and simple, there should be straightforward default settings that would generate pretty pictures easily.
    <br>
    <br> Modification of the parameters, even in "advanced" mode, should be limited and use sliders or some
    similar graphical interface.
