            <h3> Science </h3>

    I find the creation of black holes to be an extremely interesting process.
    SN 2006gy, whether or not it formed a black hole, is an awesome source
    (literally inspiring awe), and I like both the idea that it was a single
    supermassive star (a loose term in context) like Eta Carinae and a
    more-than-massive star formed from collisions to be ~100's of solar masses
    (e.g. 
<a class="norm" href="http://cdsads.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/nph-data_query?bibcode=2007Natur.450..388P&db_key=AST&link_type=ABSTRACT&high=468150f14401005">
    Portegies Zwart et al. 2007</a>).  I could easily become very interested in
<a href="http://cdsads.u-strasbg.fr/abs/2007ASPC..363..280S">stellar
    collisions</a>, if convinced that they are as common as claimed.  Update:
SN 2006gy has been a hot topic lately, and the most common scenario is no
longer the supermassive collisionally-formed star mentioned in that paper, but
the paper is still quite interesting and the new ideas are even more
interesting.

    <a href="outreach.htm"><h3> Outreach </h3></a>
    In general, I like sharing pretty pictures with the community, which is the
    most basic level of outreach.  Some of my images can be seen at <a
        class="norm" href="http://picasaweb.google.com/keflavich/L111"> L111
    </a> , <a class="norm" href="http://picasaweb.google.com/keflavich/W345">
    W345 </a>, and the NRAO Photo Contest winner and related at <a class="norm"
    href="http://picasaweb.google.com/keflavich/GC"> GC </a>
    <br>
    <br> However, that's not enough.  Ideally, an outreach project should allow
    the community to interact, understand how astronomers work, and develop a
    deeper interest in the topic.
    <br>
    <br> One interesting idea would be the creation of a 
    <a class="norm" href="game_idea.htm">flash game</a> that could provide
    useful scientific results.  I'll probably never make that, but it's a fun
    idea.

            <h3> Software</h3>

     Through my work on the <a class="norm" href="http://sage.stsci.edu/">SAGE
         survey</a>, I have also become interested in developing data
     processing software.  I wrote my own scripts using <a class="norm"
         href="http://pdl.perl.org">the Perl Data Language</a> to display
     combinations of spectral energy distributions and cutout images, sort
     through databases searching for a combination of parameters, and
     interpolate individual velocity cut images at a number of position angles
     into a complete data cube.  I use Python instead of PDL now because it's
     better supported and (somewhat) easier to install.
    <br>
    <br> <a class="norm" href="software.htm">My codes</a> are not particularly
    fast, but they weren't too difficult to write and allow me to analyze large
    data sets with little difficulty.
    <br>
<!--    <br> I believe data cube analysis and visualization is going to be extremely important for research in the 
    near future, particularly with the power of ALMA and the EVLA that will be available in a few years.  
    Fabry-Perot instruments are also capable of producing velocity cubes that can, in some cases, represent
    3-dimensional shapes.  3d stuff also looks cool.
    <br>-->
    <br> Data analysis and reduction tools are
    presently somewhat antiquated.  Command line tools like IRAF and AIPS are
    tremendously powerful, but have rather obtuse interfaces.  Python's wrapper
    for IRAF, pyraf, has partially remedied the problem for IRAF, and CASA will
    presumably do the same for radio reduction software (although in beta, its
    graphics are slow).  However, past the reduction stage, analysis is not
    always intuitive.  Graphical analysis tools are useful and getting better,
    <a class="norm" href="ds9tips.htm">DS9</a> is a wonderful tool that is
    underutilized by the majority of astronomers who know little of its
    capabilities past simple image display.  The folks at CFA who support it are 
    also very helpful and responsive.  <a class="norm"
        href="http://star-www.dur.ac.uk/~pdraper/gaia/gaia.html">GAIA</a>, part
    of the UK's <a class="norm"
        href="http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/software/starlink/download.html">Starlink</a>
    package, is a powerful data-cube analysis tool that allows instantaneous
    extraction of the third axis at any point on the image.  
    <br>
    <br>The UK group has excellent
    support even for their unfunded, unsupported software - I think they're a wonderful
    example of what astronomical computing SHOULD be but isn't.  Most astronomers aren't
    very good with computers, so a well-funded and competent support group can greatly
    enhance their efficiency.
    <br>
    <br> The problems in the near future are going to be an excess of data.
    With ALMA's coverage of far too many spectral lines, there is no simple
    solution: they need to be identified somehow.  However, for data sets that
    will come out of Pan-STARRs and (if funded) the LSST, hunting through the
    archives will be inefficient or impossible.  Scripting in perl, python, or
    whatever language is available may be the most efficent way to get through
    the data once the raw images have already been processed through some sort
    of source extraction algorithm.  
    <br>
    <br> Thankfully, the excess of data will probably make scientific verification much simpler, and there will be
    no image reduction required for the extremely large-scale surveys (I don't
    know if I really believe that).  Because the work of a researcher can be
    reduced to analysis only, science goals will be achieved more efficiently.
    <br>
    <br> Computer simulation and modeling is also becoming more efficient, and it seems that modeling groups have had
    problems of excess data for over a decade.  I hope, though, that the smaller scale models (e.g. DUSTY, STARBURST99,
    2DUST, and their ilk) can be wrapped and made more useable by the general community.  As they stand, any of these
    codes has a very steep learning curve and requries a very specialized understanding to use effectively.
    <br>
    <br> Maybe I'm interested in astronomical computing.
